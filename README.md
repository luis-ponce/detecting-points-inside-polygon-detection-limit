# detecting-points-inside-polygon-detection-limit

This repo contains a code for determining whether a point (usually high temperature point) belongs to the polygon determining the detection limts of the object
The example here is a picture of a cattle head detected with the segmentation option of YOLOV5. The generated polygon was generated with the --save-txt option of segment/predict.py
